    description: "On Koh Klang Island, years of erosion and development have damaged
      the coastline and the rich ecosystems that once sustained local life. As
      the sea crept closer, homes, wildlife, and livelihoods were lost. Today,
      the community is leading its own restoration: replanting mangroves,
      rebuilding habitats, raising native bees, and cleaning the island's
      shores. We're proud to support their efforts and partner with our friends
      Mat and Muna to revive the island's environment and protect it long into
      the future."

    description: Mitria is committed to supporting hands-off, ethical elephant
      tourism and ending the cycle of captive breeding across Asia. We've worked
      with multiple sanctuaries, contributing both direct care and financial
      support to improve the lives of elephants in need. Our efforts also focus
      on the wellbeing of mahouts, many from marginalized or refugee
      backgrounds, by promoting sanctuaries that offer fair wages, dignity, and
      humane working conditions.

    description: Afternoon rains turn landscapes lush, rivers swell, and fewer
      tourists mean quieter villages. Great for photography and cultural
      immersion.

Thailand is woven from ancient kingdoms, distinct cultures, and modern rhythms. Monks sweep temple grounds at dawn while bustling streets pulse with urban life. In the rural highlands, the new generations seamlessly blend ethnic traditions with the latest Tik Tok trends. It's almost impossible to step where no tourist has tread before here, but there's also never been a better ability to connect and contribute in positive ways.
