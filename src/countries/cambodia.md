travelTips: "Show respect when visiting temples: cover shoulders and knees. Try
  local foods like amok and bamboo sticky rice. Learn a few Khmer greetings.
  Don't take photos of people without permission, especially in rural villages.
  Don't support orphanage tourism. Don't touch or climb on temple ruins."

In Cambodia, the sacred and the scarred walk side-by-side. Beneath the grandeur of Angkor's carved faces lies a deeper story of resilience: of farmers rebuilding livelihoods, artists reviving lost dances, and elders telling stories that were once almost silenced. From the rice paddies that stretch through the plains to the jungled hills of Mondulkiri that shelter rare wildlife and indigenous villages, the people here deal with trauma by cracking jokes and purveying a humbleness that borders on deprecation, but don't let the soft smiles fool you. Cambodians wear their history like a scar and a crown.
