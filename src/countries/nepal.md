    description: The Tamang community of Arukharka's monastery, once the center of
      spiritual and cultural life, was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake. Since
      then, our friend Nima and his family have been slowly rebuilding with
      their own resources and community support. We're partnering with the Lama
      family to help complete the reconstruction.

travelTips: "Greet with \"Namaste\" and a slight bow. Dress modestly, especially
  in rural areas and monasteries. Take your time: altitude can slow even the
  fittest traveler. Don't step over people's legs or food. Don't touch religious
  objects without permission. Don't bargain aggressively; fair trade is
  appreciated."
seasons:
  - name: Dry Season / Peak Trekking (Oct–Nov)
    description: Clear skies and mountain views after the monsoon; major festivals
      include Dashain and Tihar.
  - name: Winter (Dec–Feb)
    description: Cold in the mountains but clear; lower-altitude treks and cultural
      experiences thrive. Best time for homestays in hill villages without heat
      extremes.
  - name: Spring (Mar–May)
    description: Rhododendrons bloom in the hills, and temperatures are comfortable
      for trekking.
  - name: Monsoon (Jun–Sep)
    description: Lush landscapes and fewer tourists, with some rural areas harder to
      access. Excellent for cultural programs and lower-altitude service
      projects.

Nepal rises from the hot, lowland jungles of the Terai to the cold, pointed peaks of the Himalayas. This land is home to a collection of cultures characterized by resilience, hospitality, and devotion. When asked what makes Nepal so special, those who have been lucky enough to traverse its rugged roads often remark there's "just something in the air" here. Pollution? Most likely. Magic? Most certainly.
